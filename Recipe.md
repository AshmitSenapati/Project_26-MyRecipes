> Cooking Chicken-

    4) Heat ghee or oil ina heavy bottom pot or pressure cooker. Make sure you use a large one for this. Using whole spices is optional but recommended. Use whatever you have. Recommended are- 
        - 1 bay leaf
        - 4 green cardamoms
        - 6 cloves
        - 1 inch cinnamon spice
        - 1 star anise
        - 3/4 teaspoon shahi jeera (caraway seeds)
        - 1 strand mace
    
    5) Add thinly sliced onions. On a medium heat, fry them stirring often uniformly light brown. (Don't burn them, as they leave a bitter taste).
    6) Add marinated chicken and saute until it becomes pale for 5 minutes.
    7) Lower the flame completely. Cover and cook until the chicken is soft, tender and completely cooked.
    8) Check if the chicken is cooked by pricking with a fork or knife. It has to be cooked and not overdone. Evaporate any excess moisture left in the pot by cooking further without a lid.
    9) Test the taste and add more salt if needed.
    10) Then, add-
        -1/4 cup plain youghurt
        -1 teaspoon garam masala/ biryani masala
        -1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon red chilli powder (optional)
        -1 slit green chilli pepper(optional)
        -2 tablespoons chopped mint leaves

> Making Chicken Biryani-

    11) Mix everything well. Spread it evenly in a single layer.
    12) Layer drained rice all over chicken. To a separate bowl, pour 3 cups water and add 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt. If cooking in a pot,  start with 3 cups of water at this stage. Stir and taste the water. It must be slightly salty. Pour 2 cups of this across the sides of the cooker or pot. Pour rest of the water over the rice gently.
    13) Level the rice gently on top. Add 2 tablespoons more mint leaves. Do not mix up everything, the taste of the biryani cooked in this method id good. Optionally, you can sprinkle 2 tablespoons fried onions and saffron soaked milk.
    14) Finally cover the pot or cooker.
        If cooking in a pot, cook on a medium heat until the rice is done completely. If the rice is under cooked, pour 1/4 to 1/2 cup boiling water at this stage. How much to add depends on the quality of Basmati rice. Cook covered until the Biryani rice is perfectly done, grainy and fully cooked. Rest it covered for 15 mins. If cooking in a cooker, cook for 1 whistle. Lter remove the cooker from the hot burner to stop cooking further.
    15) When the pressure releases naturally, open the lid. Gently fluff with a fork.
